## About CCleaner
CCleaner is one of the world's most trusted system optimization and cleaning utilities, designed to help users maintain their computers' performance and privacy. It operates by performing deep scans of the operating system and installed applications to identify redundant files, outdated caches, and residual data that accumulate over time. By removing this digital clutter, CCleaner can help recover significant storage space, potentially speed up system responsiveness, and reduce the risk of conflicts caused by corrupt temporary files. Its straightforward, one-click cleaning approach has made it accessible to millions of users worldwide.

Beyond basic cleaning, CCleaner offers a suite of tools for proactive system management. This includes a startup program manager to control which applications launch at boot (improving startup times), an uninstaller tool for complete software removal, a duplicate file finder to eliminate redundant documents and media, and drive wiper utilities for secure deletion. For businesses, CCleaner Professional offers centralized monitoring and deployment across multiple machines. While its core functionality shines on Windows—including the famous registry cleaner—the macOS version is tailored to clean system caches, application junk, and browser data specific to the Apple ecosystem, providing a comprehensive maintenance tool for both major platforms.
